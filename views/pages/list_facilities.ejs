    <h1>Local town facilities</h1>
    <p>
        When you arrive in a new location, you may be fascinated by all of
        the shops and attractions that it has to offer. Contrariwise, you
        may be disappointed in just how little there is to do. This page
        provides a list of all the possible facilities that are in a
        location and brief descriptions.

    <h3>Shops</h3>
    <h4 id='combat'>Combat</h4>
    <p class='note'>
        In many fantasy RPG games, combat plays a large role. There are many
        general and niche shops that players may visit.
    </p>

    <ul class='list-group'>
        <li class='list-group-item'>
            Blacksmith
            <p>
                A blacksmith will provide many services. One such service is melting
                ores and molding them into swords, daggers, or other such weapons.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class='list-group-item'>
            Fletchery
            <p>
                Fletchers are those who create arrows. They may have their own
                shop where they sell their crafted goods.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class='list-group-item'>
            Carpenter
            <p>
                Wood is a common material in many worlds, and that has made it a
                useful material for creating cheap weaponry and items.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id='magic'>Magic</h4>
    <p class='note'>
        Many fantasy games include magic, which may manifest itself in a mix
        of items, spells, and potions.
    </p>

    <ul class='list-group'>
        <li class='list-group-item'>
            Apothecary
            <p>
                Injured folks will visit the local apothecary in lieu of a hospital,
                where they can purchase herbs and potions. Some more nefarious
                apothecaries may have a selection of poisons.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class='list-group-item'>
            Magic Items
            <p>
                Larger cities may have folks who enjoy collecting and selling magic items.
                They can range from magic rings that increase your stamina to dangerous
                and cursed items.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id='food'>Food</h4>
    <p class='note'>
        Although eating is not the most exciting part of a game, the variety
        of food shops can add a bit of flavor to your game.
    </p>

    <ul class='list-group'>
        <li class='list-group-item'>
            Bakery
            <p>
                Bread is a common type of food, and bakers may extend their
                skills to baking more types of things like pies, cakes, and
                cookies.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class='list-group-item'>
            Butcher
            <p>
                Meat can come from many sources, whether animals are hunted in the
                woods or raised on a farm. Depending on the local environment, the
                types of meat available may differ. Butchers are familiar with a
                variety of knives.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class='list-group-item'>
            Brewery
            <p>
                A brewery is the origin of beers. Some may include bars for patrons
                or they may sell their drinks to nearby taverns.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class='list-group-item'>
            Winery
            <p>
                A winery is the origin of wines. Some may be positioned next to
                grape orchards, or they may obtain the grapes from an orchard out
                of town and bring them to be processed. A <i>meadery</i> is similar,
                which produces honey wines.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class='list-group-item'>
            Fish Market
            <p>
                In locations near waterways, there may be many stalls that sell whatever
                items were just caught: shrimps, lobsters, salmon, clams, and many other
                types of seafood.
            </p>

            Adventurer Store
            <p>
                Many towns will have a 'general store', which will sell pretty much
                anything you need: rope, candles, small foods, etc. They are great
                for adventurers.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class='list-group-item'>
            Stables
            <p>
                Horses allow folks to travel much faster and over longer distances without
                exhausting themselves. The ability to rent or buy horses can be very helpful.
                Additionally, there may be some need for carrying smaller folks (donkeys) and
                doing heavy labor (ox).

            Puppet Shop
            <p>
                Puppets are fun characters that can have a lot of appeal to children.
                Often puppet shows will bring in young audiences who are interested
                in the humorous scenes. Puppets can have darker connotations in fantasy
                settings such as potential associations with voodoo.

    <h3>Community</h4>
    <p class='note'>
        A town is a collection of people, and to be social there are many different

                A tavern is a common place where many walks of life will visit to
                have drinks and get food at night. Visitors may see local guards,
                adventurers, pirates, travelers, or anyone else. Taverns may also include
                lodging for those out of town and host live music. You can visit the

                Many folks look up at the stars at night, wondering what they are. Some
                folk may build large towers with the aim of discovering the truths of
                the universe. They may have a telescope pointing at the sky.

                other can be very exciting. They may compete in head-to-head combat like

                In order to study religion without the temptations of the outside world, some folks will
                become a monk or a nun. They may take vows of silence of celibacy, or may spend most of their
                days studying religious texts. Some may have more engagement with the outside world, selling
                drinks to help fund their mission.

                Many cities have appeared near waterways due to the ability to get first access to whatever
                was traded and brought on ships. A port area will feature many sailors and travelers, as well
